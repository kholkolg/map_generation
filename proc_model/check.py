def check(suggested_vertex, neighbour, newfront):
    """
    Performs the following checks on a suggestes vertex and the suggested
    connection between this vertex and his last neighbour:

    1) Is the vertex out of bounds
        If yes, dont add this Vertex
    2) Is the vertex too close to an existing vertex
        If yes, change the vector that is checked in 4 and 5 from
        [neighbor-suggested_vertex] to [neighbor-closest_existing_point]
    3) Does the the vector intersect an existing connection (road)
        If yes, only create the connection up until that intersection.
        Add that intersection to the Global_lists and fix the neighbor
        attribute of the existing connection that was "intersected".
    4) Does the vector stop shortly before an existing connection
        If yes, extend the connection up until that intersection.
        Add that intersection to the Global_lists and fix the neighbor
        attribute of the existing connection that was "intersected".
    If none of the above, simply add this vertex to the global_lists
    and the new front and return the newfront. This is the only place
    aftert config, where Vertices get added to the Global Lists. Every Time
    A vertex is added, the cKDTree used to find the closest vertices has to
    be updated.

    suggested_vertex : Vertex object
